# Version 6: Multi Tab MachineLearning Window

## Overview

In this version, we a tabbed interface integrated that allows users to perform different machine learning algorithms within the same application. Each tab provides a dedicated environment to configure, train, and evaluate specific machine learning models. This version builds upon the previous implementation, adding a more organized and user-friendly interface for machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: Users can switch between tabs to use different machine learning algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Support for multiple machine learning models.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Each tab allows users to set parameters specific to the algorithm.
- **Training and Testing**: Users can train and test models directly from the UI.
- **Visualization**: Each tab includes plots for visualizing model performance and residuals.
- **Data Management**: Easily load and manage datasets for machine learning.
